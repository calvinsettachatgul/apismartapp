# API SmartApp

This API SmartApp is the first iteration of a restful SmartThings developer API. In it's current form, it is simply a web services SmartApp and can be installed and used as such. See [Web Services SmartApps](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/smartapp-web-services-developers-guide/index.html) in the SmartThings developer documentation for more details.
